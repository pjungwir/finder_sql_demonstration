== README

This is a little Rails app to demonstrate Rails `includes` vs `preload` vs `eager_load` for [a Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40005563/has-many-finder-sql-replacement-in-rails-4-2).

Just do this:

    bundle install
    RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
    rspec spec

If you tail the test log you can see what SQL Rails is building.
